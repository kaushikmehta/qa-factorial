2. Enter Negative Integer (eg: -5)
3. Hit Enter(Return) on the keyboard

Form submission should be triggered and correspondig response is sent back to user

Nothing happens. Hitting the enter(return) key on the keyboard does not trigger the submission of the form by hitting the enter(return) key on their keyboard.
